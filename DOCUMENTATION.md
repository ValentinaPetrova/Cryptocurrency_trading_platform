No login or password is required at this stage to interact with the interface or backend APIs.

When deployed in a real environment, the following enhancements are expected:

- Authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth2

- User-specific sessions and secure login handling

- Database constraints to support multi-user operations and secure access
